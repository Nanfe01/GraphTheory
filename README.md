# 👋 Hi, I’m Nanfe Yarnap

I’m a **Machine Learning Engineer** and **Mathematician** passionate about using intelligent systems, graph theory, and optimization to solve real-world African problems.

With a background in pure mathematics and applied data science, I focus on building models and tools that make infrastructure smarter, healthcare fairer, and development more data-driven — all grounded in local context.

## 🧠 What Drives Me

I believe machine learning should be **more than algorithms and benchmarks** — it should solve problems that actually matter to people. That’s why I build systems that are:

- **Context-aware**: grounded in the realities of African cities, households, and public institutions  
- **Theory-informed**: backed by graph theory, linear algebra, and optimization  
- **Practical**: built with code, not just papers — and meant for real users  
- **Impact-oriented**: focused on equity, accessibility, and better decision-making  

I enjoy bridging the gap between mathematics, machine learning, and social impact — especially in public health, transportation, and infrastructure.
